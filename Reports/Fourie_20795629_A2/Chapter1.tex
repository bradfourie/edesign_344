\section{System overview} \label{sec:system}
A system capable of measuring voltages and currents as well as the phase differences between these sinusoidal signals can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:system_diagram}. Load voltage levels were stepped down using a voltage divider before measurements, and the current through the load was measured by amplifying the voltage over a sense resistor. Phase differences were measured by using comparators and a XOR gate to generate a PWM signal, this PWM signal was then scaled to a voltage level by using a simple low pass filter. To keep the design simplistic and the measurement circuitry reliable, only the \SI{5}{\volt} rail was used for this design, with a total expected current draw of \SI{7.2}{\milli A}.
