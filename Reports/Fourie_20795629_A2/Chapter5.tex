\chapter{System test results}
The signal conditioning system was implemented successfully as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:system_picture}, all of the sub circuits were tested under various circumstances and passed all of the design requirements with minimal noise interferance. A system test summary can be seen in Table \ref{tab:powersupplytable} showing the total current supplied by the respective power supplies to the signal conditioning circuitry, as well as the voltage level of the power supply.
