This circuit comprises the use of voltage comparators, a XOR gate as well as a low pass filter. An operational amplifier comparator compares one analogue voltage level with a reference voltage and outputs a signal based on this voltage comparison, this operational amplifier is used in open loop mode and switches between its two saturated states. %https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/opamp/op-amp-comparator.html
A XOR gate is a digital logic gate with two or more inputs and one output and performs the exclusive disjunction between these input voltage levels. \newline

A low pass filter is a circuit that allows signals with a frequency lower than that of the cut-off frequency to pass through it, and blocks all frequencies higher than the cut off frequency. A single pole low pass filter consisting of a resistor and a capacitor can be used to smooth a PWM signal into an analogue voltage level.
