\chapter{System test results}
The power supply system was implemented successfully as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:full_circuit}, all of the sub circuits were tested under various circumstances and passed all of the design requirements, with all of the crucial system measurements tabulated in Table \ref{tab:powersupplytable}. The layout of the chosen positions of the capacitors and inductors caused minimal electromagnetic interference between the components and this meant that all recorded noise measurements were within tolerance.
